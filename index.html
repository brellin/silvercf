                <h2>
                    Welcome to Chao Fever!
                </h2>

                <p>"What are chao?" Some of you may ask... I have something to tell you. I have an answer.
                </p>
                <p>Chao are small life forms found in the Sonic Adventure games. This site will help you with chao
                    raising in Sonic Adventure 2 Battle (Sa2b), which has the most extensive and best chao gardens
                    out
                    of all the games.
                </p>

                <p>Chao are not avaiable from the very start of the game. To unlock the chao garden, you must enter
                    a
                    level with the character that you want to play chao with. When you go through the level, you
                    will
                    find a sky blue box with the picture of a chao on the side on it. Break open the box and grab
                    the
                    key inside, and you can enter chao world. To do so, you must beat the level. You will then be
                    warped into chao world, and will find two chao eggs waiting for you!
                </p>

                <p>Once you have done that, chao will be available in the stage select only to the characters you
                    have
                    aquired the chao key with, so be sure to get them all!
                </p>

                <p>To get them all, you must evolve them. I have a page up that is all about evolving them. It is
                    under
                    the "Chao Tips and Tricks" tab on the left hand side of the page. If you are interested, check
                    it
                    out.
